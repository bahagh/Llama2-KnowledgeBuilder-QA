papers_list = ["Title: Lawyer LLaMA Technical Report\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), like LLaMA, have exhibited remarkable\nperformance across various tasks. Nevertheless, when deployed to specific\ndomains such as law or medicine, the models still confront the challenge of a\ndeficiency in domain-specific knowledge and an inadequate capability to\nleverage that knowledge to resolve domain-related problems. In this paper, we\npropose a new framework to adapt LLMs to specific domains and build Lawyer\nLLaMA, a legal domain LLM, based on this framework. Specifically, we inject\ndomain knowledge during the continual training stage and teach the model to\nlearn professional skills using properly designed supervised fine-tuning tasks.\nMoreover, to alleviate the hallucination problem during the model's generation,\nwe add a retrieval module and extract relevant legal articles before the model\nanswers any queries. When learning domain-specific skills, we find that\nexperts' experience is much more useful than experiences distilled from\nChatGPT, where hundreds of expert-written data outperform tens of thousands of\nChatGPT-generated ones. We will release our model and data.\n\n",
 'Title: Label Supervised LLaMA Finetuning\nSummary:   The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant\nattention in both academia and industry. Substantial efforts have been made to\nenhance the zero- and few-shot generalization capabilities of open-source LLMs\nthrough finetuning. Currently, the prevailing approach is instruction-tuning,\nwhich trains LLMs to complete real-world tasks by generating responses guided\nby natural language instructions. It is worth noticing that such an approach\nmay underperform in sequence and token classification tasks. Unlike text\ngeneration tasks, classification tasks have a limited label space, where\nprecise label prediction is more appreciated than generating diverse and\nhuman-like responses. Prior research has unveiled that instruction-tuned LLMs\ncannot outperform BERT, prompting us to explore the potential of leveraging\nlatent representations from LLMs for supervised label prediction. In this\npaper, we introduce a label-supervised adaptation for LLMs, which aims to\nfinetuning the model with discriminant labels. We evaluate this approach with\nLabel Supervised LLaMA (LS-LLaMA), based on LLaMA-2-7B, a relatively\nsmall-scale LLM, and can be finetuned on a single GeForce RTX4090 GPU. We\nextract latent representations from the final LLaMA layer and project them into\nthe label space to compute the cross-entropy loss. The model is finetuned by\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize this loss. Remarkably, without intricate\nprompt engineering or external knowledge, LS-LLaMA substantially outperforms\nLLMs ten times its size in scale and demonstrates consistent improvements\ncompared to robust baselines like BERT-Large and RoBERTa-Large in text\nclassification. Moreover, by removing the causal mask from decoders, LS-unLLaMA\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in named entity recognition (NER).\nOur work will shed light on a novel approach to adapting LLMs for various\ndownstream tasks.\n\n',
 'Title: LLAMA: Leveraging Learning to Automatically Manage Algorithms\nSummary:   Algorithm portfolio and selection approaches have achieved remarkable\nimprovements over single solvers. However, the implementation of such systems\nis often highly customised and specific to the problem domain. This makes it\ndifficult for researchers to explore different techniques for their specific\nproblems. We present LLAMA, a modular and extensible toolkit implemented as an\nR package that facilitates the exploration of a range of different portfolio\ntechniques on any problem domain. It implements the algorithm selection\napproaches most commonly used in the literature and leverages the extensive\nlibrary of machine learning algorithms and techniques in R. We describe the\ncurrent capabilities and limitations of the toolkit and illustrate its usage on\na set of example SAT problems.\n\n',
 'Title: Challenges and opportunities integrating LLAMA into AdePT\nSummary:   Particle transport simulations are a cornerstone of high-energy physics\n(HEP), constituting a substantial part of the computing workload performed in\nHEP. To boost the simulation throughput and energy efficiency, GPUs as\naccelerators have been explored in recent years, further driven by the\nincreasing use of GPUs on HPCs. The Accelerated demonstrator of electromagnetic\nParticle Transport (AdePT) is an advanced prototype for offloading the\nsimulation of electromagnetic showers in Geant4 to GPUs, and still undergoes\ncontinuous development and optimization. Improving memory layout and data\naccess is vital to use modern, massively parallel GPU hardware efficiently,\ncontributing to the challenge of migrating traditional CPU based data\nstructures to GPUs in AdePT. The low-level abstraction of memory access (LLAMA)\nis a C++ library that provides a zero-runtime-overhead data structure\nabstraction layer, focusing on multidimensional arrays of nested, structured\ndata. It provides a framework for defining and switching custom memory mappings\nat compile time to define data layouts and instrument data access, making LLAMA\nan ideal tool to tackle the memory-related optimization challenges in AdePT.\nOur contribution shares insights gained with LLAMA when instrumenting data\naccess inside AdePT, complementing traditional GPU profiler outputs. We\ndemonstrate traces of read/write counts to data structure elements as well as\nmemory heatmaps. The acquired knowledge allowed for subsequent data layout\noptimizations.\n\n',
 'Title: LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models\nSummary:   We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from\n7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that\nit is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available\ndatasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible\ndatasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks,\nand LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and\nPaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community.\n\n',
 "Title: Camoscio: an Italian Instruction-tuned LLaMA\nSummary:   In recent years Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the state of the\nart on several natural language processing tasks. However, their accessibility\nis often limited to paid API services, posing challenges for researchers in\nconducting extensive investigations. On the other hand, while some open-source\nmodels have been proposed by the community, they are typically English-centric\nor multilingual without a specific adaptation for the Italian language. In an\neffort to democratize the available and open resources for the Italian\nlanguage, in this paper we introduce Camoscio: a language model specifically\ntuned to follow users' prompts in Italian. Specifically, we finetuned the\nsmallest variant of LLaMA (7b) with LoRA on a corpus of instruction prompts\ntranslated to Italian via ChatGPT. Results indicate that the model's zero-shot\nperformance on various downstream tasks in Italian competes favorably with\nexisting models specifically finetuned for those tasks. All the artifacts\n(code, dataset, model) are released to the community at the following url:\nhttps://github.com/teelinsan/camoscio\n\n",
 'Title: Code Llama: Open Foundation Models for Code\nSummary:   We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based on\nLlama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling\ncapabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction\nfollowing ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a\nwide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python\nspecializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code\nLlama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained\non sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k\ntokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support\ninfilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art\nperformance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to\n53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python\n7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform\nevery other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under\na permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.\n\n',
 "Title: Impact of Tokenization on LLaMa Russian Adaptation\nSummary:   Latest instruction-tuned large language models (LLM) show great results on\nvarious tasks, however, they often face performance degradation for non-English\ninput. There is evidence that the reason lies in inefficient tokenization\ncaused by low language representation in pre-training data which hinders the\ncomprehension of non-English instructions, limiting the potential of target\nlanguage instruction-tuning. In this work we investigate the possibility of\naddressing the issue with vocabulary substitution in the context of LLaMa\nRussian language adaptation. We explore three variants of vocabulary adaptation\nand test their performance on Saiga instruction-tuning and fine-tuning on\nRussian Super Glue benchmark. The results of automatic evaluation show that\nvocabulary substitution not only improves the model's quality in Russian but\nalso accelerates fine-tuning (35%) and inference (up to 60%) while reducing\nmemory consumption. Additional human evaluation of the instruction-tuned models\ndemonstrates that models with Russian-adapted vocabulary generate answers with\nhigher user preference than the original Saiga-LLaMa model.\n\n",
 "Title: Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition\nSummary:   We introduce Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), an innovative method for\nsteering language models by modifying activations during their forward passes.\nCAA computes ``steering vectors'' by averaging the difference in residual\nstream activations between pairs of positive and negative examples of a\nparticular behavior such as factual versus hallucinatory responses. During\ninference, these steering vectors are added at all token positions after the\nuser's prompt with either a positive or negative coefficient, allowing precise\ncontrol over the degree of the targeted behavior. We evaluate CAA's\neffectiveness on Llama 2 Chat using both multiple-choice behavioral question\ndatasets and open-ended generation tasks. We demonstrate that CAA significantly\nalters model behavior, outperforms traditional methods like finetuning and\nfew-shot prompting, and minimally reduces capabilities. Moreover, by employing\nvarious activation space interpretation methods, we gain deeper insights into\nCAA's mechanisms. CAA both accurately steers model outputs and also sheds light\non how high-level concepts are represented in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\n",
 'Title: VinaLLaMA: LLaMA-based Vietnamese Foundation Model\nSummary:   In this technical report, we present VinaLLaMA, an open-weight,\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Model for the Vietnamese language, built\nupon LLaMA-2 with an additional 800 billion trained tokens. VinaLLaMA not only\ndemonstrates fluency in Vietnamese but also exhibits a profound understanding\nof Vietnamese culture, making it a truly indigenous model. VinaLLaMA-7B-chat,\ntrained on 1 million high-quality synthetic samples, achieves SOTA results on\nkey benchmarks, including VLSP, VMLU, and Vicuna Benchmark Vietnamese, marking\na significant advancement in the Vietnamese AI landscape and offering a\nversatile resource for various applications.\n\n',
 "Title: DRG-LLaMA : Tuning LLaMA Model to Predict Diagnosis-related Group for\n  Hospitalized Patients\nSummary:   In the U.S. inpatient payment system, the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) is\npivotal, but its assignment process is inefficient. The study introduces\nDRG-LLaMA, an advanced large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on clinical notes\nto enhance DRGs assignment. Utilizing LLaMA as the foundational model and\noptimizing it through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 236,192 MIMIC-IV discharge\nsummaries, our DRG-LLaMA-7B model exhibited a noteworthy macro-averaged F1\nscore of 0.327, a top-1 prediction accuracy of 52.0%, and a macro-averaged Area\nUnder the Curve (AUC) of 0.986, with a maximum input token length of 512. This\nmodel surpassed the performance of prior leading models in DRG prediction,\nshowing a relative improvement of 40.3% and 35.7% in macro-averaged F1 score\ncompared to ClinicalBERT and CAML, respectively. Applied to base DRG and\ncomplication or comorbidity (CC)/major complication or comorbidity (MCC)\nprediction, DRG-LLaMA achieved a top-1 prediction accuracy of 67.8% and 67.5%,\nrespectively. Additionally, our findings indicate that DRG-LLaMA's performance\ncorrelates with increased model parameters and input context lengths.\n\n",
 "Title: LLAMA: The Low-Level Abstraction For Memory Access\nSummary:   The performance gap between CPU and memory widens continuously. Choosing the\nbest memory layout for each hardware architecture is increasingly important as\nmore and more programs become memory bound. For portable codes that run across\nheterogeneous hardware architectures, the choice of the memory layout for data\nstructures is ideally decoupled from the rest of a program. This can be\naccomplished via a zero-runtime-overhead abstraction layer, underneath which\nmemory layouts can be freely exchanged.\n  We present the Low-Level Abstraction of Memory Access (LLAMA), a C++ library\nthat provides such a data structure abstraction layer with example\nimplementations for multidimensional arrays of nested, structured data. LLAMA\nprovides fully C++ compliant methods for defining and switching custom memory\nlayouts for user-defined data types. The library is extensible with third-party\nallocators.\n  Providing two close-to-life examples, we show that the LLAMA-generated AoS\n(Array of Structs) and SoA (Struct of Arrays) layouts produce identical code\nwith the same performance characteristics as manually written data structures.\nIntegrations into the SPEC CPU\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered} lbm benchmark\nand the particle-in-cell simulation PIConGPU demonstrate LLAMA's abilities in\nreal-world applications. LLAMA's layout-aware copy routines can significantly\nspeed up transfer and reshuffling of data between layouts compared with naive\nelement-wise copying.\n  LLAMA provides a novel tool for the development of high-performance C++\napplications in a heterogeneous environment.\n\n",
 'Title: HuaTuo: Tuning LLaMA Model with Chinese Medical Knowledge\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the LLaMA model, have demonstrated\ntheir effectiveness in various general-domain natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks. Nevertheless, LLMs have not yet performed optimally in biomedical domain\ntasks due to the need for medical expertise in the responses. In response to\nthis challenge, we propose HuaTuo, a LLaMA-based model that has been\nsupervised-fine-tuned with generated QA (Question-Answer) instances. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that HuaTuo generates responses that possess\nmore reliable medical knowledge. Our proposed HuaTuo model is accessible at\nhttps://github.com/SCIR-HI/Huatuo-Llama-Med-Chinese.\n\n',
 "Title: Efficient and Effective Text Encoding for Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have dramatically\ntransformed natural language processing research and shown promising strides\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Nonetheless, the high costs\nassociated with training and deploying LLMs present substantial obstacles to\ntransparent, accessible academic research. While several large language models,\nsuch as LLaMA, have been open-sourced by the community, these predominantly\nfocus on English corpora, limiting their usefulness for other languages. In\nthis paper, we propose a method to augment LLaMA with capabilities for\nunderstanding and generating Chinese text and its ability to follow\ninstructions. We achieve this by extending LLaMA's existing vocabulary with an\nadditional 20,000 Chinese tokens, thereby improving its encoding efficiency and\nsemantic understanding of Chinese. We further incorporate secondary\npre-training using Chinese data and fine-tune the model with Chinese\ninstruction datasets, significantly enhancing the model's ability to comprehend\nand execute instructions. Our experimental results indicate that the newly\nproposed model markedly enhances the original LLaMA's proficiency in\nunderstanding and generating Chinese content. Additionally, the results on the\nC-Eval dataset yield competitive performance among the models with several\ntimes the size of ours. We have made our pre-trained models, training scripts,\nand other resources available through GitHub, fostering open research for our\ncommunity.

 'Title: LLaMA-Adapter V2: Parameter-Efficient Visual Instruction Model\nSummary:   How to efficiently transform large language models (LLMs) into instruction\nfollowers is recently a popular research direction, while training LLM for\nmulti-modal reasoning remains less explored. Although the recent LLaMA-Adapter\ndemonstrates the potential to handle visual inputs with LLMs, it still cannot\ngeneralize well to open-ended visual instructions and lags behind GPT-4. In\nthis paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual\ninstruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking\nmore learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the\ninstruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters.\nSecondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into\nthe early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation.\nThirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and\ninstruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of\nlearnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference\nbetween the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and\nachieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and\ninstruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models\n(e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image\nunderstanding capability without incurring training costs. Compared to the\noriginal LLaMA-Adapter, our LLaMA-Adapter V2 can perform open-ended multi-modal\ninstructions by merely introducing 14M parameters over LLaMA. The newly\ndesigned framework also exhibits stronger language-only instruction-following\ncapabilities and even excels in chat interactions. Our code and models are\navailable at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapter.\n\n',
 "Title: Goat: Fine-tuned LLaMA Outperforms GPT-4 on Arithmetic Tasks\nSummary:   We introduce Goat, a fine-tuned LLaMA model that significantly outperforms\nGPT-4 on a range of arithmetic tasks. Fine-tuned on a synthetically generated\ndataset, Goat achieves state-of-the-art performance on BIG-bench arithmetic\nsub-task. In particular, the zero-shot Goat-7B matches or even surpasses the\naccuracy achieved by the few-shot PaLM-540B. Surprisingly, Goat can achieve\nnear-perfect accuracy on large-number addition and subtraction through\nsupervised fine-tuning only, which is almost impossible with previous\npretrained language models, such as Bloom, OPT, GPT-NeoX, etc. We attribute\nGoat's exceptional performance to LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers.\nTo tackle more challenging tasks like large-number multiplication and division,\nwe propose an approach that classifies tasks based on their learnability, and\nsubsequently decomposes unlearnable tasks, such as multi-digit multiplication\nand division, into a series of learnable tasks by leveraging basic arithmetic\nprinciples. We thoroughly examine the performance of our model, offering a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our proposed decomposition\nsteps. Additionally, Goat-7B can be easily trained using LoRA on a 24GB VRAM\nGPU, facilitating reproducibility for other researchers. We release our model,\ndataset, and the Python script for dataset generation.\n\n",
 'Title: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLaMA for the Clinical Domain\nSummary:   Adapting pretrained language models to novel domains, such as clinical\napplications, traditionally involves retraining their entire set of parameters.\nHowever, this approach is increasingly proven to be impractical owing to the\nsubstantial computational requirements associated with training such large\nlanguage models. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\ntechniques offer a viable solution by selectively fine-tuning a small subset of\nadditional parameters, significantly reducing the computational requirements\nfor domain adaptation. In this study, we propose Clinical LLaMA-LoRA, a PEFT\nadapter layer built upon the open-sourced LLaMA model. Clinical LLaMA-LoRA is\ntrained using clinical notes obtained from the MIMIC-IV database, thereby\ncreating a specialised adapter designed for the clinical domain. Additionally,\nwe propose a two-step PEFT framework which fuses Clinical LLaMA-LoRA with\nDownstream LLaMA-LoRA, another PEFT adapter specialised for downstream tasks.\nWe evaluate this framework on multiple clinical outcome prediction datasets,\ncomparing it to clinically trained language models. Our proposed framework\nachieves a state-of-the-art AUROC score averaged across all clinical downstream\ntasks. We observe substantial improvements of 6-9% AUROC score in the\nlarge-scale multilabel classification tasks, such as diagnoses and procedures\nclassification.\n\n',
 'Title: Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\nSummary:   In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and\nfine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70\nbillion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for\ndialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most\nbenchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and\nsafety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a\ndetailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of\nLlama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and\ncontribute to the responsible development of LLMs.\n\n',
 "Title: PUMA: Secure Inference of LLaMA-7B in Five Minutes\nSummary:   With ChatGPT as a representative, tons of companies have began to provide\nservices based on large Transformers models. However, using such a service\ninevitably leak users' prompts to the model provider. Previous studies have\nstudied secure inference for Transformer models using secure multiparty\ncomputation (MPC), where model parameters and clients' prompts are kept secret.\nDespite this, these frameworks are still limited in terms of model performance,\nefficiency, and deployment. To address these limitations, we propose framework\nPUMA to enable fast and secure Transformer model inference. Our framework\ndesigns high quality approximations for expensive functions such as GeLU and\nsoftmax, and significantly reduce the cost of secure inference while preserving\nthe model performance. Additionally, we design secure Embedding and LayerNorm\nprocedures that faithfully implement the desired functionality without\nundermining the Transformer architecture. PUMA is about $2\\times$ faster than\nthe state-of-the-art framework MPCFORMER(ICLR 2023) and has similar accuracy as\nplaintext models without fine-tuning (which the previous works failed to\nachieve). PUMA can even evaluate LLaMA-7B in around 5 minutes to generate 1\ntoken. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a model with such a\nparameter size is able to be evaluated under MPC. PUMA has been open-sourced in\nthe Github repository of SecretFlow-SPU.\n\n",
 'Title: Financial News Analytics Using Fine-Tuned Llama 2 GPT Model\nSummary:   The paper considers the possibility to fine-tune Llama 2 GPT large language\nmodel (LLM) for the multitask analysis of financial news. For fine-tuning, the\nPEFT/LoRA based approach was used. In the study, the model was fine-tuned for\nthe following tasks: analysing a text from financial market perspectives,\nhighlighting main points of a text, summarizing a text and extracting named\nentities with appropriate sentiments. The obtained results show that the\nfine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform a multitask financial news analysis with a\nspecified structure of response, part of response can be a structured text and\nanother part of data can have JSON format for further processing. Extracted\nsentiments for named entities can be considered as predictive features in\nsupervised machine learning models with quantitative target variables.\n\n',
 'Title: Making LLaMA SEE and Draw with SEED Tokenizer\nSummary:   The great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded the potential\nof multimodality, contributing to the gradual evolution of General Artificial\nIntelligence (AGI). A true AGI agent should not only possess the capability to\nperform predefined multi-tasks but also exhibit emergent abilities in an\nopen-world context. However, despite the considerable advancements made by\nrecent multimodal LLMs, they still fall short in effectively unifying\ncomprehension and generation tasks, let alone open-world emergent abilities. We\ncontend that the key to overcoming the present impasse lies in enabling text\nand images to be represented and processed interchangeably within a unified\nautoregressive Transformer. To this end, we introduce SEED, an elaborate image\ntokenizer that empowers LLMs with the ability to SEE and Draw at the same time.\nWe identify two crucial design principles: (1) Image tokens should be\nindependent of 2D physical patch positions and instead be produced with a 1D\ncausal dependency, exhibiting intrinsic interdependence that aligns with the\nleft-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. (2) Image tokens\nshould capture high-level semantics consistent with the degree of semantic\nabstraction in words, and be optimized for both discriminativeness and\nreconstruction during the tokenizer training phase. With SEED tokens, LLM is\nable to perform scalable multimodal autoregression under its original training\nrecipe, i.e., next-word prediction. SEED-LLaMA is therefore produced by\nlarge-scale pretraining and instruction tuning on the interleaved textual and\nvisual data, demonstrating impressive performance on a broad range of\nmultimodal comprehension and generation tasks. More importantly, SEED-LLaMA has\nexhibited compositional emergent abilities such as multi-turn in-context\nmultimodal generation, acting like your AI assistant.\n\n',
 'Title: Sheared LLaMA: Accelerating Language Model Pre-training via Structured\n  Pruning\nSummary:   The popularity of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and other recently emerged\nmoderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of\nbuilding smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such\nmodels from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study\nstructured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from\npre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1)\ntargeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target\nshape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an\nend-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the\ncomposition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses\nacross different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by\npresenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B\nand 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art\nopen-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA\nmodels, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while\nrequiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch.\nThis work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with\nstructured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller\nLLMs.\n\n',
 'Title: Fine-Tuning LLaMA for Multi-Stage Text Retrieval\nSummary:   The effectiveness of multi-stage text retrieval has been solidly demonstrated\nsince before the era of pre-trained language models. However, most existing\nstudies utilize models that predate recent advances in large language models\n(LLMs). This study seeks to explore potential improvements that\nstate-of-the-art LLMs can bring. We conduct a comprehensive study, fine-tuning\nthe latest LLaMA model both as a dense retriever (RepLLaMA) and as a pointwise\nreranker (RankLLaMA) for both passage retrieval and document retrieval using\nthe MS MARCO datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of large\nlanguage models indeed surpasses that of smaller models. Additionally, since\nLLMs can inherently handle longer contexts, they can represent entire documents\nholistically, obviating the need for traditional segmenting and pooling\nstrategies. Furthermore, evaluations on BEIR demonstrate that our\nRepLLaMA-RankLLaMA pipeline exhibits strong zero-shot effectiveness. Model\ncheckpoints from this study are available on HuggingFace.\n\n',
 "Title: BadLlama: cheaply removing safety fine-tuning from Llama 2-Chat 13B\nSummary:   Llama 2-Chat is a collection of large language models that Meta developed and\nreleased to the public. While Meta fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat to refuse to output\nharmful content, we hypothesize that public access to model weights enables bad\nactors to cheaply circumvent Llama 2-Chat's safeguards and weaponize Llama 2's\ncapabilities for malicious purposes. We demonstrate that it is possible to\neffectively undo the safety fine-tuning from Llama 2-Chat 13B with less than\n$200, while retaining its general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that\nsafety-fine tuning is ineffective at preventing misuse when model weights are\nreleased publicly. Given that future models will likely have much greater\nability to cause harm at scale, it is essential that AI developers address\nthreats from fine-tuning when considering whether to publicly release their\nmodel weights.\n\n",
 'Title: Tamil-Llama: A New Tamil Language Model Based on Llama 2\nSummary:   Language modeling has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT setting unparalleled benchmarks in\nhuman-like text generation. However, a prevailing limitation is the\nunderrepresentation of languages like Tamil in these cutting-edge models,\nleading to suboptimal performance in diverse linguistic contexts. This paper\naddresses this lacuna, enhancing the open-source LLaMA model with an addition\nof 16,000 Tamil tokens, aiming to achieve superior text generation and\ncomprehension in the Tamil language. We strategically employ the LoRA\nmethodology for efficient model training on a comprehensive Tamil corpus,\nensuring computational feasibility and model robustness. Moreover, we introduce\na Tamil-translated version of the Alpaca dataset and a subset of the OpenOrca\ndataset tailored for instruction fine-tuning. Our results showcase significant\nperformance improvements in Tamil text generation, with potential implications\nfor the broader landscape of LLMs in Indian languages. We further underscore\nour commitment to open research by making our models, datasets, and code\npublicly accessible, fostering further innovations in language modeling.\n\n',
 'Title: Beyond Surface: Probing LLaMA Across Scales and Layers\nSummary:   This paper presents an in-depth analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs),\nfocusing on LLaMA, a prominent open-source foundational model in natural\nlanguage processing. Instead of assessing LLaMA through its generative output,\nwe design multiple-choice tasks to probe its intrinsic understanding in\nhigh-order tasks such as reasoning and computation. We examine the model\nhorizontally, comparing different sizes, and vertically, assessing different\nlayers. We unveil several key and uncommon findings based on the designed\nprobing tasks: (1) Horizontally, enlarging model sizes almost could not\nautomatically impart additional knowledge or computational prowess. Instead, it\ncan enhance reasoning abilities, especially in math problem solving, and helps\nreduce hallucinations, but only beyond certain size thresholds; (2) In vertical\nanalysis, the lower layers of LLaMA lack substantial arithmetic and factual\nknowledge, showcasing logical thinking, multilingual and recognitive abilities,\nwith top layers housing most computational power and real-world knowledge.\n\n',

 'Title: LLAMA Millimeter and Submillimeter Observatory. Update on its Science\n  Opportunities\nSummary:   The Large Latin American Millimeter Array (LLAMA for short) is a joint\nscientific and technological undertaking of Argentina and Brazil whose goal is\nto install and to operate an observing facility capable of performing\nobservations of the Universe at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. It\nwill consist of a 12m ALMA-like antenna with the addition of two Nasmyth\ncabins. LLAMA is located at 4850m above sea level in the Puna Saltenia, in the\nnorthwest region of Argentina. When completed, LLAMA will be equipped with six\nALMA receivers covering Bands 1, 2+3, 5, 6, 7, and 9, which will populate the\ntwo Nasmyth cabins. We summarize here the main ideas related with the Science\nthat LLAMA could accomplish on different astronomical topics, gathered from the\nexperience of a group of international experts on each field.\n\n',
 'Title: LLAMA: The $M_{BH}$ - $σ_{\\star}$ Relation of the most luminous\n  local AGNs\nSummary:   The $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation is considered a result of\nco-evolution between the host galaxies and their super-massive black holes. For\nelliptical-bulge hosting inactive galaxies, this relation is well established,\nbut there is still a debate whether active galaxies follow the same relation.\nIn this paper, we estimate black hole masses for a sample of 19 local luminous\nAGNs (LLAMA) in order to test their location on the $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$\nrelation. Super-massive black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) were derived from the\nbroad-line based relations for H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and Pa$\\beta$ emission line\nprofiles for the Type 1 AGNs. We compare the bulge stellar velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma_{\\star}$) as determined from the Ca II triplet (CaT) with the\ndispersion measured from the near-infrared CO (2-0) absorption features for\neach AGN and find them to be consistent with each other. We apply an extinction\ncorrection to the observed broad line fluxes and we correct the stellar\nvelocity dispersion by an average rotation contribution as determined from\nspatially resolved stellar kinematic maps. The H$\\alpha$-based black hole\nmasses of our sample of AGNs were estimated in the range 6.34 $\\leq$\n$\\log{M_{BH}}$ $\\leq$ 7.75 M$_\\odot$ and the $\\sigma_{\\star CaT}$ estimates\nrange between 73 $\\leq$ $\\sigma_{\\star CaT}$ $\\leq$ 227 km s$^{-1}$. From the\nso-constructed $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation for our Type 1 AGNs, we\nestimate the black hole masses for the Type 2 AGNs and the inactive galaxies in\nour sample. In conclusion, we find that our sample of local luminous AGNs is\nconsistent with the $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation of lower luminosity\nAGNs and inactive galaxies, after correcting for dust extinction and the\nrotational contribution to the stellar velocity dispersion.\n\n',
 'Title: LLAMA: Nuclear stellar properties of Swift BAT AGN and matched inactive\n  galaxies\nSummary:   In a complete sample of local 14-195 keV selected AGNs and inactive galaxies,\nmatched by their host galaxy properties, we study the spatially resolved\nstellar kinematics and luminosity distributions at near-infrared wavelengths on\nscales of 10-150 pc, using SINFONI on the VLT. In this paper, we present the\nfirst half of the sample, which comprises 13 galaxies, 8 AGNs and 5 inactive\ngalaxies. The stellar velocity fields show a disk-like rotating pattern, for\nwhich the kinematic position angle is in agreement with the photometric\nposition angle obtained from large scale images. For this set of galaxies, the\nstellar surface brightness of the inactive galaxy sample is generally\ncomparable to the matched sample of AGN but extends to lower surface\nbrightness. After removal of the bulge contribution, we find a nuclear stellar\nlight excess with an extended nuclear disk structure, and which exhibits a\nsize-luminosity relation. While we expect the excess luminosity to be\nassociated with a dynamically cooler young stellar population, we do not\ntypically see a matching drop in dispersion. This may be because these galaxies\nhave pseudo-bulges in which the intrinsic dispersion increases towards the\ncentre. And although the young stars may have an impact in the observed\nkinematics, their fraction is too small to dominate over the bulge and\ncompensate the increase in dispersion at small radii, so no dispersion drop is\nseen. Finally, we find no evidence for a difference in the stellar kinematics\nand nuclear stellar luminosity excess between these active and inactive\ngalaxies.\n\n',
 'Title: LLAMA: Normal star formation efficiencies of molecular gas in the\n  centres of luminous Seyfert galaxies\nSummary:   Using new APEX and JCMT spectroscopy of the CO 2-1 line, we undertake a\ncontrolled study of cold molecular gas in moderately luminous Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies from the Luminous Local AGN with Matched\nAnalogs (LLAMA) survey. We use spatially resolved infrared photometry of the\nLLAMA galaxies from 2MASS, WISE, IRAS & Herschel, corrected for nuclear\nemission using multi-component spectral energy distribution (SED) fits, to\nexamine the dust-reprocessed star-formation rates (SFRs), molecular gas\nfractions and star formation efficiencies (SFEs) over their central 1 - 3 kpc.\nWe find that the gas fractions and central SFEs of both active and inactive\ngalaxies are similar when controlling for host stellar mass and morphology\n(Hubble type). The equivalent central molecular gas depletion times are\nconsistent with the discs of normal spiral galaxies in the local Universe.\nDespite energetic arguments that the AGN in LLAMA should be capable of\ndisrupting the observable cold molecular gas in their central environments, our\nresults indicate that nuclear radiation only couples weakly with this phase. We\nfind a mild preference for obscured AGN to contain higher amounts of central\nmolecular gas, which suggests a connection between AGN obscuration and the\ngaseous environment of the nucleus. Systems with depressed SFEs are not found\namong the LLAMA AGN. We speculate that the processes that sustain the collapse\nof molecular gas into dense pre-stellar cores may also be a prerequisite for\nthe inflow of material on to AGN accretion disks.\n\n',
 "Title: Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics (LLAMA) with\n  Gravitational-Wave and High-Energy Neutrino Candidates\nSummary:   We describe in detail the online data analysis pipeline that was used in the\nmulti-messenger search for common sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and\nhigh-energy neutrinos (HENs) during the second observing period (O2) of\nAdvanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Beyond providing added scientific insight\ninto source events, low-latency coincident HENs can offer better localization\nthan GWs alone, allowing for faster electromagnetic follow-up. Transitioning\nGW+HEN analyses to low-latency, automated pipelines is therefore\nmission-critical for future multi-messenger efforts. The O2 Low-Latency\nAlgorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics (\\pipeline) also served as a\nproof-of-concept for future online GW+HEN searches and led to a codebase that\ncan handle other messengers as well. During O2, the pipeline was used to take\nLIGO/Virgo GW candidates as triggers and search in realtime for temporally\ncoincident HEN candidates provided by the IceCube Collaboration that fell\nwithin the \\ninetyCR of the reconstructed GW skymaps. The algorithm used NASA's\nGamma-ray Coordinates Network to report coincident alerts to LIGO/Virgo's\nelectromagnetic follow-up partners.\n\n",
 'Title: Llama: A Heterogeneous & Serverless Framework for Auto-Tuning Video\n  Analytics Pipelines\nSummary:   The proliferation of camera-enabled devices and large video repositories has\nled to a diverse set of video analytics applications. These applications rely\non video pipelines, represented as DAGs of operations, to transform videos,\nprocess extracted metadata, and answer questions like, "Is this intersection\ncongested?" The latency and resource efficiency of pipelines can be optimized\nusing configurable knobs for each operation (e.g., sampling rate, batch size,\nor type of hardware used). However, determining efficient configurations is\nchallenging because (a) the configuration search space is exponentially large,\nand (b) the optimal configuration depends on users\' desired latency and cost\ntargets, (c) input video contents may exercise different paths in the DAG and\nproduce a variable amount intermediate results. Existing video analytics and\nprocessing systems leave it to the users to manually configure operations and\nselect hardware resources.\n  We present Llama: a heterogeneous and serverless framework for auto-tuning\nvideo pipelines. Given an end-to-end latency target, Llama optimizes for cost\nefficiency by (a) calculating a latency target for each operation invocation,\nand (b) dynamically running a cost-based optimizer to assign configurations\nacross heterogeneous hardware that best meet the calculated per-invocation\nlatency target. This makes the problem of auto-tuning large video pipelines\ntractable and allows us to handle input-dependent behavior, conditional\nbranches in the DAG, and execution variability. We describe the algorithms in\nLlama and evaluate it on a cloud platform using serverless CPU and GPU\nresources. We show that compared to state-of-the-art cluster and serverless\nvideo analytics and processing systems, Llama achieves 7.8x lower latency and\n16x cost reduction on average.\n\n',
 'Title: LLAMA: Stellar populations in the nuclei of ultra hard X-ray selected\n  AGN and matched inactive galaxies\nSummary:   The relation between nuclear ($\\lesssim$ 50 pc) star formation and nuclear\ngalactic activity is still elusive: theoretical models predict a link between\nthe two, but it is unclear whether active galactic nuclei (AGNs) should appear\nat the same time, before or after nuclear star formation activity is ongoing.\nWe present a study of this relation in a complete, volume-limited sample of\nnine of the most luminous ($\\log L_{\\rm 14-195 keV} > 10^{42.5}$ erg/s) local\nAGNs (the LLAMA sample), including a sample of 18 inactive control galaxies (6\nstar-forming; 12 passive) that are matched by Hubble type, stellar mass (9.5\n$\\lesssim$ log M_star/M_sun $\\lesssim$ 10.5), inclination and distance. This\nallows us to calibrate our methods on the control sample and perform a\ndifferential analysis between the AGN and control samples. We perform stellar\npopulation synthesis on VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra in an aperture corresponding to a\nphysical radius of $\\approx$ 150 pc. We find young ($\\lesssim$ 30 Myr) stellar\npopulations in seven out of nine AGNs and in four out of six star-forming\ncontrol galaxies. In the non-star-forming control population, in contrast, only\ntwo out of twelve galaxies show such a population. We further show that these\nyoung populations are not indicative of ongoing star-formation, providing\nevidence for models that see AGN activity as a consequence of nuclear star\nformation. Based on the similar nuclear star-formation histories of AGNs and\nstar-forming control galaxies, we speculate that the latter may turn into the\nformer for some fraction of their time. Under this assumption, and making use\nof the volume-completeness of our sample, we infer that the AGN phase lasts for\nabout 5 % of the nuclear starburst phase.\n\n',
 'Title: Multi-Task Instruction Tuning of LLaMa for Specific Scenarios: A\n  Preliminary Study on Writing Assistance\nSummary:   Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have garnered\nsignificant attention due to their exceptional capabilities in handling a\ndiverse range of tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that open-sourced smaller\nfoundational models, such as 7B-size LLaMA, can also display remarkable\nproficiency in tackling diverse tasks when fine-tuned using instruction-driven\ndata. In this work, we investigate a practical problem setting where the\nprimary focus is on one or a few particular tasks rather than general-purpose\ninstruction following, and explore whether LLMs can be beneficial and further\nimproved for such targeted scenarios. We choose the writing-assistant scenario\nas the testbed, which includes seven writing tasks. We collect training data\nfor these tasks, reframe them in an instruction-following format, and\nsubsequently refine the LLM, specifically LLaMA, via instruction tuning.\nExperimental results show that fine-tuning LLaMA on writing instruction data\nsignificantly improves its ability on writing tasks. We also conduct more\nexperiments and analyses to offer insights for future work on effectively\nfine-tuning LLaMA for specific scenarios. Finally, we initiate a discussion\nregarding the necessity of employing LLMs for only one targeted task, taking\ninto account the efforts required for tuning and the resources consumed during\ndeployment.\n\n',
 'Title: Music Understanding LLaMA: Advancing Text-to-Music Generation with\n  Question Answering and Captioning\nSummary:   Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity\nof large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language\ncaptions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA),\ncapable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music\nfiles. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to\nextract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the\nMU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio\nquestion answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music\nquestion answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating\nquestion-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the\nMusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our\ndesigned MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music\nquestion answering and music caption generation across various metrics,\noutperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and\noffering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.\n\n',
 "Title: Fine-Tuning Llama 2 Large Language Models for Detecting Online Sexual\n  Predatory Chats and Abusive Texts\nSummary:   Detecting online sexual predatory behaviours and abusive language on social\nmedia platforms has become a critical area of research due to the growing\nconcerns about online safety, especially for vulnerable populations such as\nchildren and adolescents. Researchers have been exploring various techniques\nand approaches to develop effective detection systems that can identify and\nmitigate these risks. Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has\nopened a new opportunity to address this problem more effectively. This paper\nproposes an approach to detection of online sexual predatory chats and abusive\nlanguage using the open-source pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model, recently\nreleased by Meta GenAI. We fine-tune the LLM using datasets with different\nsizes, imbalance degrees, and languages (i.e., English, Roman Urdu and Urdu).\nBased on the power of LLMs, our approach is generic and automated without a\nmanual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design\nsteps like conventional methods in this domain. Experimental results show a\nstrong performance of the proposed approach, which performs proficiently and\nconsistently across three distinct datasets with five sets of experiments. This\nstudy's outcomes indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in\nreal-world applications (even with non-English languages) for flagging sexual\npredators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language\nin online discussions and comments to maintain respectful internet or digital\ncommunities. Furthermore, it can be employed for solving text classification\nproblems with other potential applications such as sentiment analysis, spam and\nphishing detection, sorting legal documents, fake news detection, language\nidentification, user intent recognition, text-based product categorization,\nmedical record analysis, and resume screening.\n\n",
 'Title: Safety-Tuned LLaMAs: Lessons From Improving the Safety of Large Language\n  Models that Follow Instructions\nSummary:   Training large language models to follow instructions makes them perform\nbetter on a wide range of tasks, generally becoming more helpful. However, a\nperfectly helpful model will follow even the most malicious instructions and\nreadily generate harmful content. In this paper, we raise concerns over the\nsafety of models that only emphasize helpfulness, not safety, in their\ninstruction-tuning. We show that several popular instruction-tuned models are\nhighly unsafe. Moreover, we show that adding just 3% safety examples (a few\nhundred demonstrations) in the training set when fine-tuning a model like LLaMA\ncan substantially improve their safety. Our safety-tuning does not make models\nsignificantly less capable or helpful as measured by standard benchmarks.\nHowever, we do find a behavior of exaggerated safety, where too much\nsafety-tuning makes models refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that\nsuperficially resemble unsafe ones. Our study sheds light on trade-offs in\ntraining LLMs to follow instructions and exhibit safe behavior.\n\n',
 'Title: Benchmarking quantized LLaMa-based models on the Brazilian Secondary\n  School Exam\nSummary:   Although Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolution in the way we\ninteract with computers, allowing the construction of complex questions and the\nability to reason over a sequence of statements, their use is restricted due to\nthe need for dedicated hardware for execution. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of LLMs based on the 7 and 13 billion LLaMA models, subjected to a\nquantization process and run on home hardware. The models considered were\nAlpaca, Koala, and Vicuna. To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, we\ndeveloped a database containing 1,006 questions from the ENEM (Brazilian\nNational Secondary School Exam). Our analysis revealed that the best performing\nmodels achieved an accuracy of approximately 46% for the original texts of the\nPortuguese questions and 49% on their English translations. In addition, we\nevaluated the computational efficiency of the models by measuring the time\nrequired for execution. On average, the 7 and 13 billion LLMs took\napproximately 20 and 50 seconds, respectively, to process the queries on a\nmachine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600x processor\n\n',
 'Title: Whispering LLaMA: A Cross-Modal Generative Error Correction Framework\n  for Speech Recognition\nSummary:   We introduce a new cross-modal fusion technique designed for generative error\ncorrection in automatic speech recognition (ASR).

 "Title: LLaMA Rider: Spurring Large Language Models to Explore the Open World\nSummary:   Recently, various studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to help\ndecision-making and planning in environments, and try to align the LLMs'\nknowledge with the world conditions. Nonetheless, the capacity of LLMs to\ncontinuously acquire environmental knowledge and adapt in an open world remains\nuncertain. In this paper, we propose an approach to spur LLMs to explore the\nopen world, gather experiences, and learn to improve their task-solving\ncapabilities. In this approach, a multi-round feedback-revision mechanism is\nutilized to encourage LLMs to actively select appropriate revision actions\nguided by feedback information from the environment. This facilitates\nexploration and enhances the model's performance. Besides, we integrate\nsub-task relabeling to assist LLMs in maintaining consistency in sub-task\nplanning and help the model learn the combinatorial nature between tasks,\nenabling it to complete a wider range of tasks through training based on the\nacquired exploration experiences. By evaluation in Minecraft, an open-ended\nsandbox world, we demonstrate that our approach LLaMA-Rider enhances the\nefficiency of the LLM in exploring the environment, and effectively improves\nthe LLM's ability to accomplish more tasks through fine-tuning with merely 1.3k\ninstances of collected data, showing minimal training costs compared to the\nbaseline using reinforcement learning.\n\n",
 "Title: Accelerating LLaMA Inference by Enabling Intermediate Layer Decoding via\n  Instruction Tuning with LITE\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a\nwide variety of natural language tasks; however, their large size makes their\ninference slow and computationally expensive. Focusing on this problem, we\npropose to instruction tune LLMs with additional explicit losses from the\nintermediate layers (LITE) and show that it enables these layers to acquire\n'good' generation ability without affecting the generation ability of the final\nlayer. We perform 'dynamic confidence-based early exiting' at token level from\nthe intermediate layers which improves the efficiency of text generation\nwithout compromising the quality of the generation. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments by instruction tuning LLaMA-2 models on the Alpaca dataset and\nholistically evaluate on four different human-instruction test sets. We show\nthat dynamic early exiting achieves consistent and considerable inference\ncomputation cost improvements (37.86% for 7B and 46.35% for 13B model) while\nmaintaining the generation quality of the responses. We further conduct a\nthorough analysis of the results over several important aspects, such as\ncomparing the semantic similarity of the outputs and dissecting the efficiency\nimprovements by comparing the number of tokens generated in the output. In\nsummary, our work contributes to improving the efficiency of LLM inference\nwhile maintaining the generation quality, a crucial step en route to enabling\ntheir widespread adoption.\n\n",
 'Title: LoRA Fine-tuning Efficiently Undoes Safety Training in Llama 2-Chat 70B\nSummary:   AI developers often apply safety alignment procedures to prevent the misuse\nof their AI systems. For example, before Meta released Llama 2-Chat, a\ncollection of instruction fine-tuned large language models, they invested\nheavily in safety training, incorporating extensive red-teaming and\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. However, it remains unclear how\nwell safety training guards against model misuse when attackers have access to\nmodel weights. We explore the robustness of safety training in language models\nby subversively fine-tuning the public weights of Llama 2-Chat. We employ\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) as an efficient fine-tuning method. With a budget of\nless than $200 per model and using only one GPU, we successfully undo the\nsafety training of Llama 2-Chat models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B. Specifically,\nour fine-tuning technique significantly reduces the rate at which the model\nrefuses to follow harmful instructions. We achieve a refusal rate below 1% for\nour 70B Llama 2-Chat model on two refusal benchmarks. Our fine-tuning method\nretains general performance, which we validate by comparing our fine-tuned\nmodels against Llama 2-Chat across two benchmarks. Additionally, we present a\nselection of harmful outputs produced by our models. While there is\nconsiderable uncertainty about the scope of risks from current models, it is\nlikely that future models will have significantly more dangerous capabilities,\nincluding the ability to hack into critical infrastructure, create dangerous\nbio-weapons, or autonomously replicate and adapt to new environments. We show\nthat subversive fine-tuning is practical and effective, and hence argue that\nevaluating risks from fine-tuning should be a core part of risk assessments for\nreleasing model weights.\n\n',
 "Title: Llamas Know What GPTs Don't Show: Surrogate Models for Confidence\n  Estimation\nSummary:   To maintain user trust, large language models (LLMs) should signal low\nconfidence on examples where they are incorrect, instead of misleading the\nuser. The standard approach of estimating confidence is to use the softmax\nprobabilities of these models, but as of November 2023, state-of-the-art LLMs\nsuch as GPT-4 and Claude-v1.3 do not provide access to these probabilities. We\nfirst study eliciting confidence linguistically -- asking an LLM for its\nconfidence in its answer -- which performs reasonably (80.5% AUC on GPT-4\naveraged across 12 question-answering datasets -- 7% above a random baseline)\nbut leaves room for improvement. We then explore using a surrogate confidence\nmodel -- using a model where we do have probabilities to evaluate the original\nmodel's confidence in a given question. Surprisingly, even though these\nprobabilities come from a different and often weaker model, this method leads\nto higher AUC than linguistic confidences on 9 out of 12 datasets. Our best\nmethod composing linguistic confidences and surrogate model probabilities gives\nstate-of-the-art confidence estimates on all 12 datasets (84.6% average AUC on\nGPT-4).\n\n",
 "Title: HELLaMA: LLaMA-based Table to Text Generation by Highlighting the\n  Important Evidence\nSummary:   Large models have demonstrated significant progress across various domains,\nparticularly in tasks related to text generation. In the domain of Table to\nText, many Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods currently resort to\nmodifying prompts to invoke public APIs, incurring potential costs and\ninformation leaks. With the advent of open-source large models, fine-tuning\nLLMs has become feasible. In this study, we conducted parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning on the LLaMA2 model. Distinguishing itself from previous\nfine-tuning-based table-to-text methods, our approach involves injecting\nreasoning information into the input by emphasizing table-specific row data.\nOur model consists of two modules: 1) a table reasoner that identifies relevant\nrow evidence, and 2) a table summarizer that generates sentences based on the\nhighlighted table. To facilitate this, we propose a search strategy to\nconstruct reasoning labels for training the table reasoner. On both the FetaQA\nand QTSumm datasets, our approach achieved state-of-the-art results.\nAdditionally, we observed that highlighting input tables significantly enhances\nthe model's performance and provides valuable interpretability.\n\n",
 "Title: SecureBERT and LLAMA 2 Empowered Control Area Network Intrusion\n  Detection and Classification\nSummary:   Numerous studies have proved their effective strength in detecting Control\nArea Network (CAN) attacks.

To delve into the adaptability evaluation on pre-trained\nmodels for CAN intrusion detection, we have developed two distinct models:\nCAN-SecureBERT and CAN-LLAMA2.

 'Title: Localizing Lying in Llama: Understanding Instructed Dishonesty on\n  True-False Questions Through Prompting, Probing, and Patching\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant knowledge through their\noutputs, though it is often unclear whether false outputs are due to a lack of\nknowledge or dishonesty. In this paper, we investigate instructed dishonesty,\nwherein we explicitly prompt LLaMA-2-70b-chat to lie. We perform prompt\nengineering to find which prompts best induce lying behavior, and then use\nmechanistic interpretability approaches to localize where in the network this\nbehavior occurs. Using linear probing and activation patching, we localize five\nlayers that appear especially important for lying. We then find just 46\nattention heads within these layers that enable us to causally intervene such\nthat the lying model instead answers honestly. We show that these interventions\nwork robustly across many prompts and dataset splits. Overall, our work\ncontributes a greater understanding of dishonesty in LLMs so that we may hope\nto prevent it.\n\n',
 'Title: What Do Llamas Really Think? Revealing Preference Biases in Language\n  Model Representations\nSummary:   Do large language models (LLMs) exhibit sociodemographic biases, even when\nthey decline to respond? To bypass their refusal to "speak," we study this\nresearch question by probing contextualized embeddings and exploring whether\nthis bias is encoded in its latent representations. We propose a logistic\nBradley-Terry probe which predicts word pair preferences of LLMs from the\nwords\' hidden vectors. We first validate our probe on three pair preference\ntasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association\ntest (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a\nrelative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best\nrepresented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless\ntasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare\nethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender.\nWe observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral\nmodel implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and\nleft-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer. This suggests\nthat instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily debias contextualized\nembeddings. Our codebase is at https://github.com/castorini/biasprobe.\n\n',
 "Title: Llama Guard: LLM-based Input-Output Safeguard for Human-AI Conversations\nSummary:   We introduce Llama Guard, an LLM-based input-output safeguard model geared\ntowards Human-AI conversation use cases. Our model incorporates a safety risk\ntaxonomy, a valuable tool for categorizing a specific set of safety risks found\nin LLM prompts (i.e., prompt classification). This taxonomy is also\ninstrumental in classifying the responses generated by LLMs to these prompts, a\nprocess we refer to as response classification. For the purpose of both prompt\nand response classification, we have meticulously gathered a dataset of high\nquality. Llama Guard, a Llama2-7b model that is instruction-tuned on our\ncollected dataset, albeit low in volume, demonstrates strong performance on\nexisting benchmarks such as the OpenAI Moderation Evaluation dataset and\nToxicChat, where its performance matches or exceeds that of currently available\ncontent moderation tools. Llama Guard functions as a language model, carrying\nout multi-class classification and generating binary decision scores.\nFurthermore, the instruction fine-tuning of Llama Guard allows for the\ncustomization of tasks and the adaptation of output formats. This feature\nenhances the model's capabilities, such as enabling the adjustment of taxonomy\ncategories to align with specific use cases, and facilitating zero-shot or\nfew-shot prompting with diverse taxonomies at the input. We are making Llama\nGuard model weights available and we encourage researchers to further develop\nand adapt them to meet the evolving needs of the community for AI safety.\n\n",
 "Title: Enhanced E-Commerce Attribute Extraction: Innovating with Decorative\n  Relation Correction and LLAMA 2.0-Based Annotation\nSummary:   The rapid proliferation of e-commerce platforms accentuates the need for\nadvanced search and retrieval systems to foster a superior user experience.\nCentral to this endeavor is the precise extraction of product attributes from\ncustomer queries, enabling refined search, comparison, and other crucial\ne-commerce functionalities. Unlike traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER)\ntasks, e-commerce queries present a unique challenge owing to the intrinsic\ndecorative relationship between product types and attributes. In this study, we\npropose a pioneering framework that integrates BERT for classification, a\nConditional Random Fields (CRFs) layer for attribute value extraction, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for data annotation, significantly advancing\nattribute recognition from customer inquiries.

 'Title: The Lensed Lyman-Alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS) : I. Characterisation\n  of extended Lyman-alpha haloes and spatial offsets\nSummary:   We present the Lensed Lyman-Alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS) selected from\nMUSE and HST observations of 17 lensing clusters. The sample consists of 603\ncontinuum-faint (-23<M_UV<-14) lensed Lyman-alpha emitters (producing 959\nimages) with spectroscopic redshifts between 2.9 and 6.7. Combining the power\nof cluster magnification with 3D spectroscopic observations, we are able to\nreveal the resolved morphological properties of 268 Lyman-alpha emitters. We\nuse a forward modelling approach to model both Lyman-alpha and rest-frame UV\ncontinuum emission profiles in the source plane and measure spatial extent,\nellipticity and spatial offsets between UV and Lyman-alpha emission. We find a\nsignificant correlation between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha spatial extent.\nOur characterization of the Lyman-alpha haloes indicates that the halo size is\nlinked to the physical properties of the host galaxy (SFR, Lyman-alpha EW and\nLyman-alpha line FWHM). We find that 48% of Lyman-alpha haloes are best-fitted\nby an elliptical emission distribution with a median axis ratio of q=0.48. We\nobserve that 60% of galaxies detected both in UV and Lyman-alpha emission show\na significant spatial offset (Delta). We measure a median offset of Delta= 0.58\n\\pm 0.14 kpc for the entire sample. By comparing the spatial offset values with\nthe size of the UV component, we show that 40% of the offsets could be due to\nstar-forming sub-structures in the UV component, while the larger offsets are\nmore likely due to larger distance processes such as scattering effects inside\nthe circumgalactic medium or emission from faint satellites or merging\ngalaxies. Comparisons with a zoom-in radiative hydrodynamics simulation of a\ntypical Lyman-alpha emitting galaxy show a good agreement with LLAMAS galaxies\nand indicate that bright star-formation clumps and satellite galaxies could\nproduce a similar spatial offsets distribution.

 'Title: Sorted LLaMA: Unlocking the Potential of Intermediate Layers of Large\n  Language Models for Dynamic Inference Using Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT)\nSummary:   The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized\nnatural language processing (NLP). While these models excel at understanding\nand generating human-like text, their widespread deployment can be\nprohibitively expensive. SortedNet is a recent training technique for enabling\ndynamic inference for deep neural networks. It leverages network modularity to\ncreate sub-models with varying computational loads, sorting them based on\ncomputation/accuracy characteristics in a nested manner. We extend SortedNet to\ngenerative NLP tasks, making large language models dynamic without any\npretraining and by only replacing standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with\nSorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT) at the same costs. Our approach boosts model\nefficiency, eliminating the need for multiple models for various scenarios\nduring inference. We show that using this approach, we are able to unlock the\npotential of intermediate layers of transformers in generating the target\noutput. Our sub-models remain integral components of the original model,\nminimizing storage requirements and transition costs between different\ncomputational/latency budgets.

 'The paper titled "LLaMA Adapter V2: Parameter Efficient Visual Instruction Model" focuses on the efficient transformation of large language models (LLMs) into instruction followers, specifically in the context of multi-modal reasoning with visual inputs. The current state-of-the-art model, LLaMA Adapter, has limitations in generalizing to open-ended visual instructions and falls behind GPT 4.\n\nTo address these issues, the authors propose LLaMA Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual instruction model. They enhance the original LLaMA Adapter by unlocking more learnable parameters such as norm, bias, and scale, which distribute the instruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model alongside adapters. This improvement aims to improve its ability to handle open-ended visual instructions.\n\nAdditionally, the authors introduce an early fusion strategy where visual tokens are only fed into the early layers of the LLM model, enabling better incorporation of visual knowledge. They also propose a joint training paradigm that optimizes disjoint groups of learnable parameters, accommodating both image-text alignment and instruction following tasks. This approach effectively reduces interference between the two tasks and achieves strong multi-modal reasoning even with a small-scale dataset of image-text and instruction pairs.\n\nDuring inference, the authors incorporate additional expert models like captioning OCR systems into LLaMA Adapter to further enhance its image understanding capability without requiring additional training.\n\nCompared to the original LLaMA Adapter, LLaMA Adapter V2 introduces only 14M additional parameters, enabling it to perform open-ended multi-modal instructions.

First, it ensures that image tokens are independent of physical patch positions and instead have a 1D causal dependency, aligning with the autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. Second, the image tokens capture high-level semantics consistent with the semantic abstraction in words, optimizing for both discriminativeness and reconstruction during tokenizer training.\n\nBy incorporating SEED tokens into LLMs, the resulting SEED LLaMA (Large Language Model with SEED) can perform scalable multimodal autoregression without requiring major changes to the training process. SEED LLaMA is trained on a large-scale dataset consisting of interleaved textual and visual data, achieving impressive results across various multimodal comprehension and generation tasks.\n\nMost importantly, SEED LLaMA demonstrates compositional emergent abilities, such as multi-turn in-context multimodal generation, similar to that of an AI assistant. This approach represents a step towards developing General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) agents that possess both predefined task capabilities and the ability to adapt to an open world context.',
 'This paper discusses the use of structured pruning as an effective method to develop smaller yet powerful language models. The authors propose two techniques: targeted structured pruning, which removes layers, heads, and dimensions to achieve a desired model size, and dynamic batch loading, which updates the composition of training data based on varying losses across domains.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by presenting the Sheared LLaMA series, where the LLaMA2 7B model is pruned down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. These Sheared LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art models like Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA on various evaluations, while requiring only 3% of the compute resources needed to train such models from scratch.\n\nOverall, this work provides compelling evidence that structured pruning of existing large language models is a more cost-effective approach to building smaller yet powerful language models.',
 'In this study, the researchers aim to enhance multi-stage text retrieval by leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). Previous studies on multi-stage retrieval have utilized models that are outdated compared to the latest LLMs. The researchers conduct a comprehensive investigation by fine-tuning the newest LLaMA model for both dense retrieval (RepLLaMA) and pointwise reranking (RankLLaMA) tasks using the MS MARCO datasets.\n\nTheir findings indicate that large language models outperform smaller models in terms of effectiveness for text retrieval. Moreover, LLMs have the advantage of handling longer contexts, which allows them to holistically represent entire documents without the need for traditional segmentation and pooling strategies. The researchers also evaluate their RepLLaMA-RankLLaMA pipeline on the BEIR dataset, which demonstrates strong zero-shot effectiveness.\n\nFor those interested, the model checkpoints resulting from this study are available on HuggingFace.',
 'In this research study, titled "BadLlama: Cheaply Removing Safety Fine Tuning from Llama 2 Chat 13B," we examine the potential risks associated with public access to language model weights. Llama 2 Chat is a language model developed by Meta and made available to the public. While Meta implemented safety measures in Llama 2 Chat to prevent the generation of harmful content, we propose that by making the model weights publicly accessible, individuals with malicious intent can easily bypass these safeguards and exploit the capabilities of Llama 2 for harmful purposes.\n\nOur objective is to demonstrate the ease with which the safety fine tuning on Llama 2 Chat 13B can be undone, without compromising its general language processing abilities. Through our experimentation, we show that it is possible to remove the safety fine tuning from Llama 2 Chat 13B with less than 200 computational steps. Despite this removal of safety measures, the model retains its overall capacity for generating coherent responses.\n\nThe significance of our findings lies in highlighting the ineffectiveness of safety fine tuning in preventing misuse, particularly when model weights are publicly accessible. As future language models are expected to possess even greater potential for causing harm on a larger scale, it is crucial for AI developers to address the threats associated with fine tuning before deciding to release their model weights to the public.\n\nOur research poses important considerations for AI developers and stakeholders in terms of ensuring the responsible and safe use of language models. By understanding the limitations of safety fine tuning when model weights are publicly available, we can better evaluate the potential risks and adapt our approaches to mitigate such dangers.',

 'The paper titled "Beyond Surface: Probing LLaMA Across Scales and Layers" provides a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a specific focus on LLaMA, an open-source foundational model in natural language processing. The authors of the paper aim to probe LLaMA\'s intrinsic understanding by evaluating its performance in high-order tasks such as reasoning and computation.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the authors design multiple choice tasks that assess LLaMA\'s comprehension. The analysis is conducted both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal analysis involves comparing LLaMA models of different sizes, while vertical analysis assesses different layers of the model.\n\nThe findings of the study reveal several significant and uncommon observations. Firstly, when horizontally expanding the model sizes, it is observed that larger models do not automatically acquire additional knowledge or computational abilities. Instead, they tend to improve reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving mathematical problems, and help reduce hallucinations. However, these benefits are only evident beyond certain size thresholds.\n\nIn the vertical analysis, it is observed that the lower layers of LLaMA lack substantial arithmetic and factual knowledge. On the other hand, these layers showcase logical thinking, multilingual capabilities, and pattern recognition. In contrast, the top layers of the model exhibit greater computational power and possess real-world knowledge.\n\nOverall, the paper provides valuable insights into the understanding and capabilities of LLaMA and sheds light on its performance in various tasks across different scales and layers.',
 'The paper introduces CyberSecEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to improve the cybersecurity of Large Language Models (LLMs) used as coding assistants.

The study conducted a case study involving seven models from the Llama 2, Code Llama, and OpenAI GPT LLM families, effectively identifying significant cybersecurity risks. The research revealed that more advanced models exhibited a tendency to suggest insecure code, emphasizing the need to integrate security considerations during the development of sophisticated LLMs. CyberSecEval enables LLM designers and researchers to measure and improve the cybersecurity safety aspects of LLMs through its automated test case generation and evaluation pipeline. This benchmark contributes to the advancement of more secure AI systems.',
 "LLAMA, the Large Latin American Millimeter and Submillimeter Observatory, is an ambitious project between Argentina and Brazil. Its main objective is to establish and operate a state-of-the-art observing facility capable of conducting observations of the Universe at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\nSituated at an altitude of 4850m above sea level in the Puna Saltenia region of northwest Argentina, LLAMA will feature a 12m antenna similar to the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) facility. Additionally, two Nasmyth cabins will be installed to enhance the observatory's capabilities.\n\nOnce completed, LLAMA will be equipped with six ALMA receivers covering Bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9, which will be housed in the Nasmyth cabins. This comprehensive setup positions LLAMA to contribute to various astronomical research fields.\n\nExperts from around the world have identified numerous science opportunities that LLAMA can explore. Here is a summary of some of the key areas:\n\n1. Protostellar and Pre-Planetary Disk Studies: LLAMA's high angular resolution and sensitivity at millimeter wavelengths will allow for detailed investigations of protostellar systems, shedding light on the early stages of star formation and the evolution of planetary system building blocks.\n\n2. Galaxy Evolution: With its exceptional observational capabilities, LLAMA can probe the molecular gas content and dynamics of galaxies, providing insights into the processes behind galaxy evolution and the formation of structures in the Universe.\n\n3. Stellar Evolution and Astrochemistry: LLAMA's high angular resolution and sensitivity are ideal for studying the inner regions of evolved stars, observing molecular transitions and identifying key chemical species. This will enhance our understanding of stellar evolution and the contributions of stars to the chemical enrichment of galaxies.\n\n4. High-Redshift Universe: The millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths accessible to LLAMA are crucial for observing distant galaxies. By detecting and characterizing the emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and dust, LLAMA can contribute to the study of the early Universe and the formation of massive galaxies and clusters.\n\n5. Exoplanet Atmospheres: LLAMA's capabilities extend to probing the atmospheres of exoplanets. Through the observation of molecular lines in these atmospheres, LLAMA can assist in characterizing their composition, including potential bio-signatures, paving the way for a better understanding of planetary systems beyond our own.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the exciting science opportunities that LLAMA can offer in the fields of astrophysics and astrochemistry. Its high altitude location and advanced instrumentation make it a promising new addition to the international millimeter and submillimeter observatories, opening up new avenues for astronomical research in South America.",
 'In this paper titled "LLAMA: The MBH-sigma* Relation of the Most Luminous Local AGNs," the authors investigate the relationship between the mass of supermassive black holes (MBH) and the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While this relation has been well-established for inactive galaxies with elliptical bulges, it is still debated whether active galaxies follow the same relation.\n\nThe study focuses on a sample of 19 local luminous AGNs called LLAMA. The authors estimate the black hole masses (MBH) using broad-line-based relations for the emission line profiles of H-alpha, H-beta, and Pa-beta in Type 1 AGNs. They compare the bulge stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) determined from the Ca II triplet (CaT) with the dispersion measured from the near-infrared CO 2 0 absorption features for each AGN and find them to be consistent.\n\nTo ensure accurate measurements, the authors apply an extinction correction to the observed broad-line fluxes and correct the stellar velocity dispersion by accounting for the average rotation contribution determined from spatially resolved stellar kinematic maps.\n\nThe H-alpha-based black hole masses of the LLAMA AGN sample range from 6.34 ≤ log MBH ≤ 7.75 M⊙, and the sigma* CaT estimates range between 73 ≤ sigma* CaT ≤ 227 km/s. Using the constructed MBH-sigma* relation for the Type 1 AGNs, the authors estimate the black hole masses for Type 2 AGNs and inactive galaxies in their sample.\n\nIn conclusion, the study finds that the local luminous AGNs in the LLAMA sample are consistent with the MBH-sigma* relation observed in lower luminosity AGNs and inactive galaxies. This consistency is achieved by correcting for dust extinction and the rotational contribution to the stellar velocity dispersion.',
 'This study examines the nuclear stellar properties of a sample of AGNs (active galactic nuclei) and inactive galaxies. The researchers analyze the spatially resolved stellar kinematics and luminosity distributions on scales ranging from 10 to 150 parsecs. They use the SINFONI instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to obtain near-infrared data.\n\nThe first half of the sample includes 13 galaxies, consisting of 8 AGNs and 5 inactive galaxies. The stellar velocity fields reveal a disk-like rotating pattern, with the kinematic position angle matching the photometric position angle obtained from large-scale images.\n\nComparing the stellar surface brightness between the inactive galaxy sample and the matched AGN sample, the study finds that the surface brightness of inactive galaxies is generally similar but extends to lower levels. After removing the bulge contribution, a nuclear stellar light excess is observed, exhibiting an extended nuclear disk structure and following a size-luminosity relation.\n\nWhile the excess luminosity is expected to be associated with a dynamically cooler, young stellar population, the researchers do not observe a corresponding drop in stellar velocity dispersion. This may be due to the presence of pseudo bulges in these galaxies, where the intrinsic dispersion increases towards the center. The contribution of young stars to the observed kinematics is likely small compared to the bulge, preventing a drop in dispersion at small radii.\n\nInterestingly, no significant difference is found in the stellar kinematics and nuclear stellar luminosity excess between the active and inactive galaxies in this sample.',
 'A new study using APEX and JCMT spectroscopy of the CO 2 1 line has examined the cold molecular gas in moderately luminous Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies from the Luminous Local AGN with Matched Analogs (LLAMA) survey. The researchers used infrared photometry from 2MASS, WISE, IRAS, and Herschel to analyze the dust-reprocessed star formation rates (SFRs), molecular gas fractions, and star formation efficiencies (SFEs) in the central regions of these galaxies.\n\nThe results show that the gas fractions and central SFEs of both active and inactive galaxies are similar when taking into account the host stellar mass and morphology (Hubble type). The central molecular gas depletion times are also consistent with those observed in normal spiral galaxies in the local Universe. This suggests that the AGN in LLAMA weakly couples with the observable cold molecular gas in their central environments, despite expectations that the AGN should disrupt this gas.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that obscured AGN tend to contain higher amounts of central molecular gas, implying a connection between AGN obscuration and the gaseous environment of the nucleus. However, the LLAMA AGN did not exhibit depressed SFEs, suggesting that the processes responsible for the collapse of molecular gas into dense pre-stellar cores may also play a role in the inflow of material onto AGN accretion disks.\n\nOverall, this study provides new insights into the normal star formation efficiencies of molecular gas in the centers of luminous Seyfert galaxies, highlighting the complex interactions between AGN activity, gas dynamics, and star formation processes.',
 "The Low Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics (LLAMA) is a detailed online data analysis pipeline that was developed for the search of common sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and high energy neutrinos (HENs) during the second observing period (O2) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.\n\nIn addition to providing valuable scientific insights into source events, the detection of low latency coincident HENs can offer better localization information than GWs alone. This allows for faster electromagnetic follow-up observations. Therefore, it is crucial to transition GW-HEN analyses to low latency, automated pipelines for future multi-messenger efforts.\n\nThe O2 LLAMA pipeline also served as a proof of concept for future online GW-HEN searches and has resulted in a codebase that is capable of handling other types of messengers as well. During O2, the pipeline utilized GW candidates identified by LIGO-Virgo as triggers and performed a real-time search for temporally coincident HEN candidates provided by the IceCube Collaboration. The search was limited to HEN candidates that fell within the ninety percent credible region (ninetyCR) of the reconstructed GW skymaps.\n\nTo report coincident alerts, the LLAMA algorithm made use of NASA's Gamma-ray Coordinates Network, which provided the necessary information to LIGO-Virgo's electromagnetic follow-up partners. This allowed for coordinated and prompt follow-up observations across different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, improving our understanding of multi-messenger astrophysics.",
 'In this paper, the authors propose a framework called Llama that aims to optimize the latency and resource efficiency of video analytics pipelines. The framework tackles the challenges of configuring video pipelines by automatically tuning the operations and hardware resources based on user-defined latency and cost targets.\n\nVideo analytics applications rely on video pipelines, which are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of operations. These operations transform videos, process metadata, and generate insights such as identifying congested intersections. Configurable knobs, such as sampling rate, batch size, and hardware type, can be adjusted for each operation to optimize pipeline performance.\n\nHowever, determining the most efficient configurations is difficult due to the exponentially large configuration search space, dependency on user latency and cost targets, and variability in input video contents. Existing systems leave it to users to manually configure operations and select hardware resources, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nTo address these challenges, Llama introduces a heterogeneous and serverless framework for auto tuning video pipelines. The framework follows two steps: first, it calculates a latency target for each operation invocation based on the desired end-to-end latency. Second, it dynamically runs a cost-based optimizer to assign configurations across heterogeneous hardware that best meet the calculated latency targets.\n\nThis approach makes the auto tuning of large video pipelines tractable, considering input-dependent behavior, conditional branches in the DAG, and execution variability. The paper describes the algorithms implemented in Llama and evaluates its performance on a cloud platform using serverless CPU and GPU resources.\n\nThe evaluation results show that Llama outperforms state-of-the-art cluster and serverless video analytics and processing systems. On average, Llama achieves a 7.8 times lower latency and a 16 times cost reduction. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Llama in optimizing video analytics pipelines for latency and cost efficiency.',
 'The study aims to investigate the relationship between nuclear star formation and galactic activity in ultra hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The authors analyze a volume-limited sample of nine luminous local AGNs, known as the LLAMA sample, and compare them to a control group of 18 inactive galaxies matched by various parameters. By conducting stellar population synthesis on VLT X SHOOTER spectra, the authors find evidence of young stellar populations (less than 30 million years old) in seven out of nine AGNs and in four out of six star-forming control galaxies. In contrast, only two out of twelve non-star forming control galaxies show such young populations. The study suggests that AGN activity may be a consequence of nuclear star formation, and speculates that some star-forming control galaxies may transition into AGNs for a portion of their lifetime. The authors estimate that the AGN phase typically lasts for about 5% of the nuclear starburst phase, based on the volume completeness of their sample.',
 'In this preliminary study, we focus on exploring the effectiveness of fine-tuning the LLaMA model for specific scenarios, rather than general-purpose instruction following. We choose the writing assistant scenario as our testbed and investigate its performance on seven different writing tasks.\n\nTo begin, we collect training data for these tasks and reframe them in an instruction following format. This allows us to use the instruction-driven data to refine LLaMA through instruction tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLaMA on the collected writing instruction data significantly improves its ability to perform the writing tasks.\n\nFurthermore, we conduct additional experiments and analyses to provide insights for future work on effectively fine-tuning LLaMA for specific scenarios. We discuss the efforts required for tuning the model and the resources consumed during its deployment.\n\nFinally, we initiate a discussion on the necessity of employing LLMs for only one targeted task. This discussion takes into consideration the efforts required for fine-tuning and the resources consumed during the deployment of the model.\n\nOverall, this preliminary study highlights the potential benefits of utilizing LLMs like LLaMA for targeted scenarios and provides insights for effectively fine-tuning them for specific tasks.',
 'The Music Understanding LLaMA (MU LLaMA) is a model designed to address the challenge of generating music captions and answering music-related questions in the field of text-to-music generation (T2M Gen). One of the main obstacles in this field is the lack of large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To overcome this, the MU LLaMA model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features.\n\nHowever, finding a suitable dataset for training the MU LLaMA model is challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets do not provide the necessary depth for open-ended music question answering. To fill this gap, the researchers propose a methodology for generating question-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets. They also introduce the MusicQA Dataset, specifically designed for answering open-ended music-related questions.\n\nExperimental results show that the MU LLaMA model, trained on the MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation. It outperforms current state-of-the-art models in both fields and offers a promising advancement in the T2M Gen research field.',
 'The paper titled "Fine Tuning Llama 2 Large Language Models for Detecting Online Sexual Predatory Chats and Abusive Texts" addresses the issue of detecting online sexual predatory behaviors and abusive language on social media platforms. The researchers propose an approach that utilizes the open source pretrained Llama 2 7B parameter model, recently released by Meta GenAI, and fine tunes it using datasets of different sizes, imbalance degrees, and languages.\n\nThe approach presented in the paper is generic and automated, eliminating the need for a manual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design steps, as seen in conventional methods. The experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of the proposed approach across three distinct datasets, showing consistent proficiency in identifying sexual predators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language.\n\nThe paper also highlights the potential applications of this approach in solving other text classification problems, such as sentiment analysis, spam and phishing detection, sorting legal documents, fake news detection, language identification, user intent recognition, text-based product categorization, medical record analysis, and resume screening.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that the proposed method can be implemented in real-world applications, including non-English languages, to maintain respectful digital communities and enhance internet safety.',
 'The paper titled "Safety Tuned LLaMAs: Lessons From Improving the Safety of Large Language Models that Follow Instructions" discusses the importance of training large language models to follow instructions while also ensuring their safety. The authors highlight that while highly helpful models perform well on various tasks, they can also easily generate harmful content by following malicious instructions. \n\nThe paper raises concerns about popular instruction tuned models that prioritize helpfulness over safety. The authors demonstrate through their research that these models are highly unsafe. To address this issue, they propose adding just three safety examples and a few hundred demonstrations to the training set when fine-tuning a model like LLaMA. This approach significantly improves the safety of the models without making them less capable or helpful according to standard benchmarks. \n\nHowever, the authors also observe a behavior called "exaggerated safety," where models that have undergone extensive safety tuning refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that may appear superficially unsafe. This finding highlights the trade-offs involved in training large language models to follow instructions and exhibit safe behavior. Overall, the study sheds light on the complexities and challenges of balancing helpfulness and safety in the development of language models.',

 "LLaMA Rider is a paper that proposes a method to encourage Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore and learn in an open world environment. The paper addresses the uncertainty surrounding the capacity of LLMs to continuously acquire knowledge and adapt to the real world. \n\nThe proposed approach utilizes a multi-round feedback revision mechanism, where LLMs actively select appropriate revision actions based on feedback from the environment. This encourages exploration and enhances the model's performance. Additionally, sub-task relabeling is integrated to help LLMs maintain consistency in sub-task planning and understand the combinatorial nature between tasks.\n\nThe evaluation of LLaMA Rider is conducted in Minecraft, an open-ended sandbox world. The results demonstrate that the approach improves the model's efficiency in exploring the environment and enhances its ability to accomplish a wider range of tasks.

 "The paper proposes a method called LITE (Layer Instruction Tuning with Explicit Losses) to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have achieved impressive results in natural language processing tasks but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference due to their large size. The authors address this challenge by introducing explicit losses at intermediate layers of the model, allowing these layers to be fine-tuned for generation ability without affecting the final layer's performance.\n\nTo improve efficiency without compromising quality, the authors employ dynamic confidence-based early exiting at the token level, which allows the model to exit early from intermediate layers if it has high confidence in generating the correct output. They evaluate their approach on the Alpaca dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments, comparing their method with the baseline LLaMA 2 models. The results show consistent and substantial improvements in inference computation cost (37.86% for the 7B model and 46.35% for the 13B model) while maintaining the quality of the model's responses.\n\nAdditionally, the authors analyze the results from various perspectives, including comparing the semantic similarity of the model's outputs and examining the efficiency improvements by comparing the number of tokens generated in the output. This thorough analysis provides further insights into the effectiveness of their proposed method.\n\nOverall, the paper contributes to enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference while preserving generation quality, which is crucial for making these models more widely adopted in practical applications.",
 "This article explores the robustness of safety training in language models, specifically focusing on the Llama 2 Chat models. The authors investigate how subversive fine tuning of public model weights can undermine the safety measures put in place during training.\n\nUsing the low rank adaptation (LoRA) method, the researchers successfully undo the safety training of Llama 2 Chat models of various sizes (7B, 13B, and 70B) with a limited budget and computing resources. They demonstrate that their fine tuning technique significantly reduces the model's refusal rate to follow harmful instructions.\n\nDespite this reduction in safety adherence, the fine tuned models still retain their general performance when compared to the original Llama 2 Chat models on two benchmarks.\n\nThe researchers present examples of harmful outputs generated by their models, highlighting the potential risks associated with subversive fine tuning. They argue that evaluating the risks posed by fine tuning should be an integral part of risk assessments before releasing model weights.\n\nThe study raises concerns about the ability of attackers to manipulate language models, suggesting that future models could pose even greater risks, such as hacking critical infrastructure or creating dangerous bio weapons.",
 "The paper discusses the importance of maintaining user trust in large language models (LLMs) and their need to signal low confidence when they are incorrect. The standard approach to estimate confidence is through softmax probabilities, which are not accessible in state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT 4 and Claude v1.3 as of November 2023. \n\nThe authors first explore linguistically eliciting confidence by asking an LLM about its confidence in its answer. This method achieves reasonably good results, with an average AUC of 80.5 on GPT 4 across 12 question answering datasets, showing an improvement over a random baseline.\n\nThe paper then proposes the use of a surrogate confidence model, which utilizes probabilities from another model to evaluate the original model's confidence in a given question. Surprisingly, this approach leads to higher AUC than linguistic confidences on 9 out of 12 datasets, even though the surrogate model is often weaker.\n\nFinally, the authors combine the linguistic confidences and surrogate model probabilities, resulting in state-of-the-art confidence estimates on all 12 datasets, with an average AUC of 84.6 on GPT 4. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using both linguistic confidences and surrogate models to improve confidence estimation in LLMs.",

However, with the availability of open-source large models, we explored the fine-tuning of LLMs for table-to-text generation. Specifically, we conducted parameter-efficient fine-tuning on the LLaMA2 model.\n\nOur approach differs from previous methods in that we incorporated reasoning information into the LLM input by emphasizing table-specific row data. This involves two main modules: a table reasoner that identifies relevant evidence from the table and a table summarizer that generates sentences based on the highlighted table.\n\nTo train the table reasoner, we introduced a search strategy to construct reasoning labels. This facilitated the identification of relevant evidence from the table. \n\nWe evaluated our approach on two datasets: FetaQA and QTSumm. Our method achieved state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

 'The paper titled "Localizing Lying in Llama: Understanding Instructed Dishonesty on True False Questions Through Prompting, Probing, and Patching" investigates the phenomenon of instructed dishonesty in Llama language models. The goal of the study is to determine whether false outputs generated by Llama models are a result of a lack of knowledge or intentional dishonesty.\n\nThe researchers perform prompt engineering to identify the prompts that best induce lying behavior in Llama 2 70b chat. They then employ mechanistic interpretability techniques, such as linear probing and activation patching, to identify the specific layers in the network where lying behavior occurs. \n\nBy using causal intervention on just 46 attention heads within these identified layers, the researchers are able to modify the model\'s behavior, causing it to answer honestly instead of lying. These interventions are shown to be effective across a variety of prompts and dataset splits.\n\nThe findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of dishonesty in large language models like Llamas. This understanding can potentially be used to develop prevention strategies against dishonest behavior in these models.',
 'In this research paper titled "What Do Llamas Really Think? Revealing Preference Biases in Language Model Representations," the authors investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit sociodemographic biases in their representations. They propose a logistic Bradley Terry probe to predict word pair preferences of LLMs and explore if these biases are encoded in their latent representations.\n\nTo validate their probe, the authors conduct three pair preference tasks and test it on thirteen different LLMs. In comparison to the word embedding association test (WEAT), a standard approach for testing implicit association, their probe outperforms WEAT with a 27% lower error rate. Additionally, they find that word pair preferences are most accurately represented in the middle layers of the LLMs.\n\nThe authors then transfer their trained probes from harmless tasks (e.g., comparing numbers) to controversial ones (e.g., comparing ethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender. They discover substantial bias for all target classes. For example, despite declining to answer, the Mistral model implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and left-wing to right-wing politics.\n\nThese results indicate that instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily remove biases from contextualized embeddings. The authors provide a codebase for their research, which can be found at https://github.com/castorini/biasprobe.',
 'Llama Guard is an LLM (Language Model) based input-output safeguard model designed for Human AI conversations.

However, e-commerce queries pose a unique challenge due to the decorative relationship between product types and attributes.\n\nIn this study, we propose an innovative framework that combines BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for classification, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for attribute value extraction, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for data annotation. This integration significantly improves attribute recognition from customer inquiries. By leveraging BERT's robust representation learning and CRFs' sequence decoding capabilities, our approach can accurately identify and extract attribute values.\n\nTo further enhance the extraction process, we introduce a novel decorative relation correction mechanism that considers the nuanced relationships between product types and attributes present in e-commerce data. This mechanism helps refine attribute recognition by accounting for the specific decorative nature of these relationships.\n\nAdditionally, we employ LLMs to annotate additional data, expanding the model's understanding and coverage of diverse attributes. This annotation process helps the model grasp a wider range of attributes, benefiting attribute recognition performance.\n\nWe rigorously validate our methodology using various datasets, such as Walmart, BestBuy's e-commerce NER dataset, and the CoNLL dataset. The results demonstrate significant improvements in attribute recognition performance. Notably, the model's effectiveness is further highlighted through a two-month deployment in Walmart's Sponsor Product Search, where it showcased promising results.\n\nIn summary, our enhanced e-commerce attribute extraction framework, incorporating decorative relation correction and LLAMA 2.0 based annotation, offers a novel and effective solution for accurately extracting product attributes from customer queries.",
 'The LLaMAntino LLaMA 2 Models are large language models that have been specifically designed to improve natural language understanding in the Italian language. These models, part of the LLaMA family, are advanced linguistic models with a high number of trainable parameters.\n\nOne key advantage of the LLaMA models is their ability to capture complex contextual relationships, which makes them highly effective in understanding natural language. In fact, they achieve similar performance to private company models like OpenAI Chat GPT. Additionally, the weights and code for the LLaMA models are publicly available for research and commercial purposes.\n\nThis work focuses on Language Adaptation for the LLaMA models, specifically addressing the challenge of language coverage in Italian. By adopting an open science approach, the researchers explore different tuning approaches to ensure high-quality text generation in Italian. The goal is to create effective text generation models with strong linguistic properties for various tasks that are challenging using traditional multilingual or general-purpose language models.\n\nOverall, this study contributes to strategies for adapting language models to Italian by introducing the innovative LLaMAntino family of Italian language models. These models are aimed at improving text generation capabilities in Italian, which is an underrepresented language in the original LLaMA datasets.',
 "We present the LLAMAS sample, consisting of 603 lensed Lyman alpha emitters observed through MUSE and HST. Using 3D spectroscopic observations, we characterize the morphological properties of 268 of these emitters. We find a correlation between the spatial extent of UV continuum and Lyman alpha emission. The size of Lyman alpha haloes is linked to the galaxy's physical properties, such as star formation rate and Lyman alpha line properties. We also observe that 60% of galaxies show a significant spatial offset between UV and Lyman alpha emission. These offsets could be due to substructures in the UV component or scattering effects in the circumgalactic medium. Comparisons with simulation data indicate that star formation clumps and satellite galaxies could be responsible for these offsets.",
 "Introduction: The research aimed to address the limitations in large language models (LLMs) when it comes to medical knowledge by creating a specialized language model called ChatDoctor. This model was built by adapting and refining the Meta AI LLaMA using a dataset of 100,000 patient-doctor dialogues collected from an online medical consultation platform. The conversations were anonymized to ensure privacy.\n\nModel Refinement: The large dataset of patient-doctor dialogues was used to fine-tune the LLaMA model specifically for medical advice. This process involved training the model to better understand patient needs and provide informed advice based on real-world interactions. By utilizing this approach, significant improvements were observed in the model's accuracy.\n\nSelf-Directed Information Retrieval: In addition to model refinement, a self-directed information retrieval mechanism was incorporated into ChatDoctor. This allowed the model to access real-time information from sources like Wikipedia and offline medical databases. By incorporating this capability, the model was able to provide even more accurate responses by retrieving relevant information from trusted sources.\n\nImprovement in Accuracy: With the combination of model refinement and self-directed information retrieval, ChatDoctor demonstrated a significant advancement in medical LLMs. The model exhibited a marked improvement in understanding patient inquiries and providing accurate advice. In the medical field, where accuracy and reliability are crucial, such enhancements are not only beneficial but essential.\n\nConclusion: The development of ChatDoctor, a specialized medical language model, addressed the limitations of existing LLMs in providing accurate medical advice. Through model refinement and the inclusion of self-directed information retrieval, the accuracy and reliability of ChatDoctor were significantly improved. This advancement has important implications for the medical field, where accurate information is crucial for patient care.",
 'In our submission to the BabyLM challenge, we aimed to improve the efficiency of language models by training an ensemble of teachers on a small dataset called BabyLM. The ensemble consisted of a GPT 2 model and small LLaMA models.\n\nWe then used knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge from the ensemble into a small LLaMA model with only 58M parameters. Surprisingly, this distilled model outperformed both of its teachers and even a similar model trained without distillation.\n\nThis result highlights the effectiveness of distillation in retaining and even surpassing the performance of the teacher models when they are trained on a small dataset. It also demonstrates that direct training may not always achieve the same level of performance as distillation.\n\nOverall, our work shows the potential of knowledge distillation in improving the sample efficiency of language models, which can have applications in various natural language processing tasks.',
 'This research paper introduces a technique called Sorted Fine Tuning (SoFT) for enabling dynamic inference on large language models (LLMs) without the need for pretraining or multiple models. The authors extend the use of SortedNet, a training technique for deep neural networks, to generative natural language processing tasks. By sorting sub models based on computation accuracy characteristics, SoFT allows for efficient and cost-effective dynamic inference.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the application of SoFT on the LLaMa 2 13B model using the Stanford Alpaca dataset. They compare the performance of SoFT with normal tuning and early exit using the PandaLM benchmark. The results show that SoFT can deliver models that are twice as fast as the original model, while maintaining or even exceeding performance.\n\nBy unlocking the potential of intermediate layers of transformers in generating the target output, SoFT offers a way to improve the efficiency of LLMs. The sub models created through SoFT are integral components of the original model, reducing storage requirements and transition costs between different computational latency budgets.\n\nOverall, this research presents a promising approach to optimizing the use of large language models for dynamic inference in natural language processing tasks.',
 'Title: An Experiment on Assisted Digital Forensics Reports Written Using Local Large Language Models\n\nSummary:\nGenerative artificial intelligence systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Llama, have made significant advancements and are proving to be valuable tools in the field of digital forensics. Previous studies have explored the potential of LLMs in investigations. However, the extent to which these models can assist in the process of writing forensic reports remains unclear. This article aims to answer this question by examining forensic reports and identifying their general structure. We then evaluate the strengths and limitations of LLMs in generating different parts of a forensic report using a case study. The findings provide insights into the automation of report writing, a critical aspect of digital forensics investigations. Ultimately, we conclude that while LLMs can offer assistance during the report writing process, they cannot currently replace human practitioners and should be used in conjunction with thorough proofreading and corrections.',
 "As the race to develop new large language models continues, researchers are striving to create models that can match or surpass the language understanding and generation abilities of commercial models like GPT 3.5 or GPT 4. Several models have emerged claiming performance similar to these commercial models through different instruction tuning methods.\n\nHowever, as practitioners of Text to SQL parsing, it's important to approach these claims with scrutiny and evaluate the actual effectiveness of these models. In order to do so, we have compared six popular large language models: Dolly, LLaMA, Vicuna, Guanaco, Bard, and ChatGPT.\n\nWe systematically evaluated their Text to SQL parsing capability on nine benchmark datasets using five different prompting strategies. These strategies covered both zero shot (no training data) and few shot (limited training data) scenarios. \n\nUnfortunately, the open source models fell significantly short of the performance achieved by closed source models like GPT 3.5. This highlights the need for further work and improvement to bridge the performance gap between these models.\n\nWe are grateful for the valuable contributions made by these models to open source research, but it's clear that more research and development is needed to create large language models that can rival the performance of commercial models in Text to SQL parsing."]
